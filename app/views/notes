1. Themes Recommended
Zen Themes - responsive and non-responsive version
Bootstrap - more out of the box


2. Deployment
Don't merge
Just move to themes folders to master branch

3. Packages
Jquery need updating
Package? not familiar

LESS (read only)
do it locally as compiled file

4. Images
adjust CKEditor (dropdown styles) to add the new bootstrap style
grep through database
catchall rule - catch image tag and define max size

5. Drupal 8
stable but too early to tell (wait a year?); 5 years

6. Panels - layout is great
However: good for a few layers

7. Monster Menus
takes over entire website
deeply embedded
groupings, menus
a lot of work, not automated
Node Access ? not sure if it will work with Panels (weird)
might be able to work with organic groups

8. Zen Theme
responsive and non-responsive version

9. Testing 
   a. Chrome tools
   b. responsivetest.net
   c. manual testing: hit major iphone, androids, tablets
search: "theme testing" take snapshot, not as interactive
harder to automate

10. Accessibility Toolkits on web
Wave - evaluate test
see scanner
